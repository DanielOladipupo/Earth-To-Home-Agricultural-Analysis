## Introduction 
To enhance agricultural productivity and resource allocation in South Africa, there is a need to analyze the distribution and scale of farming activities across provinces and evaluate crop and animal production within Gauteng. The goal is to identify trends, disparities, and potential areas for improvement in agricultural output and sustainability, leveraging insights from farm distribution, land usage, and production metrics.
This analysis involves estimating gross margins at each stage of the value chain and identifying regional and production-specific trends. Specifically:
- Determine which provinces host the majority of farms and analyze the types of agricultural activities prevalent in these regions.
- Examine farm distribution in Gauteng province, focusing on the number of farms and their primary produce categories, including crop and animal production metrics.
